#Privacy policy

**Plastic** is as you know an app that stores your credit card information. To ensure the safety of whatever information you enter into the app, the database itself is encrypted (AES256) with an encryption key that's the SHA512 hash of your selected password + some salt.

What this means for you as the user is basically that I've taken good measure to make sure that your information stays safe. There are no ads, the app doesn't send data anywhere (heck, I don't even have the INTERNET permission), and other apps won't be able to access the data in the database. I'd say that's an OK fullfillment of whatever privacy you as the user may expect from an app nowadays.
